                <p>Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in supporting muscle growth and recovery. Whether you are aiming to build lean muscle mass, increase strength, or enhance athletic performance, here are some essential nutrition tips:</p>
                <h2>1. Eat Sufficient Protein</h2>
                <p>Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Aim to include high-quality protein sources such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and plant-based proteins like tofu and tempeh in your diet.</p>
                <h2>2. Consume Complex Carbohydrates</h2>
                <p>Carbohydrates provide the energy needed for intense workouts and support muscle glycogen replenishment. Choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes over simple sugars.</p>
                <h2>3. Prioritize Healthy Fats</h2>
                <p>Healthy fats are crucial for hormone production and overall health. Include sources of unsaturated fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like salmon in your diet.</p>
                <h2>4. Stay Hydrated</h2>
                <p>Water is essential for nutrient transport, muscle function, and overall performance. Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day, especially before, during, and after workouts.</p>
                <h2>5. Time Your Meals</h2>
                <p>Optimize muscle growth by spreading your protein intake evenly throughout the day and consuming carbohydrates before and after workouts to fuel and replenish your muscles.</p>
                <p>Remember, consistency and balance are key when it comes to nutrition for muscle growth. Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice based on your goals and dietary preferences.</p>
